## Introduction

This analysis examines the relationship between physical activity and mental health among U.S. adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Mental health outcomes include the number of mentally unhealthy days and depression status. Analyses are conducted overall and stratified by age group.

# Discussion
# Physical activity was consistently associated with better mental health outcomes across adulthood. Although associations appeared strongest among middle-aged adults, interaction testing did not show significant differences by age group. Because NHANES is cross-sectional, causal relationships cannot be inferred.

# Conclusion
# Physical activity was associated with fewer mentally unhealthy days and lower odds of depression among U.S. adults across all age groups. These findings support public health efforts to promote physical activity as a way to improve mental well-being.
